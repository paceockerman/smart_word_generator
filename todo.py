# Summary: Train an algorithm to generate words that one likes.
# TODO: First iteration - create letter distribution


# Step 1: Generate a word via gen_word(params)
# Step 2: Have user rate the word for liking-ness
# Step 3: Learn which features the user finds desirable / undesirable

# Optional Steps: Generate words using user-preferred parameters


# Words must have certain features that determine how much the user likes them
# Basic: Graphemes -- TD: Syllable count, syllable structures,
# Extra: Repeated letters, harmony between sounds, absolute length, grapheme combinations
